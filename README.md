# Loan-Approved
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on given features.

The dataset includes various attributes such as applicant's income, credit score, loan amount, employment history, and other relevant factors typically considered by financial institutions during the loan approval process.

The main objectives of this project are:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that significantly influence the loan approval decision.

Model Training: Utilizing the SVM algorithm to train a predictive model on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface or API where users can input their information, and the model can predict the likelihood of loan approval.

Through this project, I aim to provide insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions and develop a reliable predictive model that can assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions. The code and documentation will be made available on GitHub for anyone interested in replicating the project or exploring further.
